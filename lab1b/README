lab1b-client.c
=================
The client program opens a connection to a server with the option --port=portNum rather than
sending it directly to a shell. The other options are --log=fileName which maintains a
record of data sent and received over the socket and --encrypt=fileName which contains a key
for encryption and decryption. The client sends input from the keyboard to the socket (while
echoing to the display), and input from the socket to the display.


=================
lab1b-server.c
=================
The server program connects with the client, receives the client's commands and sends them
to the shell, and will "serve" the client the outputs of those commands. The server program
has two options: --port=portNum which specifies the port number to connect, and
--encrypt=fileName which contains a key for encryption and decryption.


================
my.key
================
Contains a key string


===============
Makefile
===============
Contains code to build the program with -Wall and -Wextra options, a tarball, and clean &
dist target.
